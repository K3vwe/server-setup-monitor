# Automated Server Setup with Bash and Log File Monitoring & Alerts

This project automates server setup and continuous log monitoring using Bash scripts. It is designed to simplify server provisioning and ensure real-time alerts for critical errors or events in log files. This solution is ideal for DevOps enthusiasts, system administrators, and developers who want a streamlined way to maintain and monitor servers.

## Features
 Automated Server setup
  - Installs essential packages and dependencies.
  - Configures environment variables and system settings.
  - Sets up user permissions and security configurations.
  - Prepares the server for deployment of applications

 Log File Monitoring & Alerts
  - Continuously monitors specified log files for changes.
  - Detects and filters critical errors or patterns.
  - Sends real-time alerts via email or messaging platforms
  - Maintains a log of alerts for auditing and debugging purposes.

## Requirements
 - Linux server (Ubuntu/Debian/CentOS recommended)
 - Bash 4.0+
 - msmtp or sendmail for email alerts
 - grep, awk, tail, sed (default Linux tools)
 - Internet connection (for package installation and alerts)

## Configuration
 - Alerting: Update the email recipient or Slack webhook in the script.
 - Log Paths: Modify the paths of log files to monitor.
 - Error Patterns: Customize patterns for grep or awk to filter specific events.

### Usage
 - Configure your log files and alert patterns in monitor_logs.sh.
 - Run the monitoring script:
    ./monitor_logs.sh
 - The script will continuously watch for errors and write alerts to alerts.log while sending notifications in real-time.
